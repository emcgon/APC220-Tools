# APC220 Programmer
An Arduino program and schematic for a hardware programmer for APC220 radios. See a quick demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKSJeXSkzc (the video was intended for a few people involved in organising the local [CanSat](https://esero.ie/cansat/) competition: that's what the references to "launchers" are all about).

**NB: Schematic is a work in progress: I'm not sure it is 100% accurate. I need to reverse-engineer my working unit to verify some details. I will add the Kicad file here when complete.**

<ins>UPDATE:</ins> There is a whole new version on the way. What started out as a quick task to draw up the schematic for the existing unit in Kicad has grown a bit. I have the schematic done and a PCB layout designed, dimensioned to fit into a standard Hammond Manufacturing project box (widely available). I amd currently awaiting delivery of PCBs from the fab. Once I have those and have tested them, I'll post the updated software, the Kicad files and a BoM here (along with some pictures). Stay tuned !

Here are 3D renders of the front and back of the current iteration of the PCB from KiCad:-
